# Work-Day Scheduler

## Description
This project is a simple web application that allows you to plan out each hour of your work day from 9am-5pm. Each day the web app will automatically update the date displayed at the top of the page. You can save your tasks for each hour and they will stay there until you remove them. The time slots are dynamically updated as the hour passes by and is indicated with gray for past, red for present, and green for future. Building this project I was able to practice using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, and Day.js.
